# SOLID Principles in JavaScript

This repository provides clear and concise **JavaScript examples** to demonstrate the **SOLID principles** of object-oriented design. Each principle is illustrated with a **bad example (violation)** and a **good example (correct implementation)** to help you understand and apply these concepts effectively.

## 📌 Overview of SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym representing five design principles that promote **maintainable, scalable, and robust** software:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
   A class or module should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility.

2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)  
   Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
   Subclass objects should be substitutable for their superclass objects without breaking the application.

4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
   Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
   High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized to provide one file per SOLID principle, each containing both a violation and a correct implementation:
SOLID-Principles/
├── SRP.js  # Single Responsibility Principle
├── OCP.js  # Open/Closed Principle
├── LSP.js  # Liskov Substitution Principle
├── ISP.js  # Interface Segregation Principle
├── DIP.js  # Dependency Inversion Principle
└── README.md  # Project documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to explore the examples:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SOLID-Principles.git


2-Navigate to the Project Directory
cd SOLID-Principles

1-Run an Example
Open any file (e.g., SRP.js) in your preferred code editor to review the code. Then, execute it using Node.js: 
1. **Node js**  
   ```bash
   node SRP.js

🎯 Project Goals
This repository aims to:

Provide simple and practical JavaScript examples for learning SOLID principles.
Demonstrate both correct and incorrect implementations to clarify common pitfalls.
Serve as a reference for applying SOLID principles in real-world JavaScript projects.
